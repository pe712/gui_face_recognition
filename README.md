Greatly inspired by FaceTag repo by @roth-a

## Main features
- Easy and complete gui to tag faces in images
- Efficiently generates the embeddings
- Auto-save process: you can stop and restart at any point

## Quick start

## Steps
1. Generating the embeddings
This step is long and can be stopped and restarted at any point. There is no need for the user and you can run this at night

2. Tagging the faces
It makes links between names and faces. This is the only step that requires user input
You can see the output in the output folder. By default, it is temporary because usually, the user does not use it that much. You can change this in the settings.

3. Looking for someone
You can search for a specific person in the database. If you do not find enough results, you can continue the tagging process. In particular, you should train on pictures containing the person you are looking for.
