- propose 4 options instead of 3
- define a constant for the unknown value
- when "Unknown", do not copy file but store "Unknown" as the name
=> if matching an unknown, same

This is only the training task
The classification folder should always be put in a temp folder

We want an option to only lookup for one specific person
We could in such case also train on a specific folder

gui with all the parameters

save also Face.auto as True if the person has been found with high confidence and make stats on this

I should specify a minimum quality threshold for the faces
Indicate to the user when the quality is too low
Provide a way for the user to also specify if the face is not good enough
